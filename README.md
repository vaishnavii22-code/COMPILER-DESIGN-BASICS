THIS PROJECT IMPEMENTS A SIMPLE ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION PARSER AND EVALUATOR USING C++. THE PROGRAM ACCEPTS A MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSION FROM THE USER VIA STANDARD INPUT AND THEN COMPUTES AND DISPLAYS THE RESULT. IT SUPPORTS BASIC ARITHMETIC OPEARTIONS INCLUDING ADDITION (+), SUBTRACTION (-), MULTIPLICATION (*), DIVISION (/). PARANTHESIS () ARE ALSO HANDLED TO ENFORCE OPERATOR PRECEDENCE. THE MAIN IDEA BEHIND THIS PROGRAM IS TO DEMONSTRATE HOW EXPRESSIONS CAN BE PROCESSED CHARACTER - BY - CHARACTER TO PERFORM CALCULATIONS. THE CLASS PARSER IS AT THE CORE OF THE PROGRAM. IT CONTAINS THREE IMPORTANT METHODS: parseExpression(), parseterm() and parsefactor(). EACH OF THESE METHODS HANDLES A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF OPERATOR PRECEDENCE. parseExpression() HANDLES ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION, WHICH HAVE THE LOWEST PRECEDENCE. parseterm() HANDLES MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION, WHICH ARE OF HIGHER PRECEDENCE. prasefactor() HANDLES INDIVIDUAL NUMBERS AND SUB- EXPRESSIONS WRAPPED IN PARATHESES.

WHEN A USER RUNS THE PROGRAM, THE MAIN()IN SUMMARY, THIS PROJECT IS A PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EXPRESSION PARSER IN C++, DEMONSTRATING THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF PARSING, RECURSION, AND OPERATOR PRECEDENCE WITHOUT DEPENDING ON EXTERNAL LIBRARIES. IT IS HIGHLY EDUCATIONAL, MODULAR, AND EASY TO EXTEND.ROMPTS THEM TO ENTER AN ARITHMETIC EXPRESSION. THIS EXPRESSION IS READ AS A STRING, AND THEN PASSED TO THE PARSEEXPRESSION FUNCTION ALONG WITH AN INDEX THAT TRACKS THE CURRENT POSITION IN THE STRING. AS THE EXPRESSION IS EVALUATED, THE INDEX IS UPDATED TO MOVE THROUGH THE CHARACTERS IN ORDER. THE FINAL RESULT IS THEN PRINTED TO THE SCREEN.

THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO IGNORE WHITESPACE, ALLOWING USERS TO WRITE EXPRESSIONS IN A MORE NATURAL WAY, LIKE 2 + 3 * (4 - 1). PARENTHESES ARE FULLY SUPPORTED, ALLOWING USERS TO CONTROL THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, (2 + 3) * 4 WILL EVALUATE TO 20, WHILE 2 + 3 * 4 WILL RESULT IN 14, CORRECTLY FOLLOWING MATHEMATICAL PRECEDENCE RULES.

THIS CODE SERVES AS A SIMPLE YET POWERFUL DEMONSTRATION OF HOW PARSERS WORK. RECURSIVE DESCENT PARSING IS A COMMON METHOD USED IN INTERPRETERS AND COMPILERS TO PROCESS LANGUAGE STRUCTURE, AND THIS PROJECT ILLUSTRATES ITS USE IN A CLEAR AND STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY. DEVELOPERS AND STUDENTS CAN EASILY BUILD UPON THIS BASE TO CREATE MORE ADVANCED EXPRESSION EVALUATORS THAT SUPPORT FLOATING POINT NUMBERS, UNARY OPERATORS, ERROR HANDLING, AND EVEN VARIABLES.

IN SUMMARY, THIS PROJECT IS A PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EXPRESSION PARSER IN C++, DEMONSTRATING THE CORE PRINCIPLES OF PARSING, RECURSION, AND OPERATOR PRECEDENCE WITHOUT DEPENDING ON EXTERNAL LIBRARIES. IT IS HIGHLY EDUCATIONAL, MODULAR, AND EASY TO EXTEND.
